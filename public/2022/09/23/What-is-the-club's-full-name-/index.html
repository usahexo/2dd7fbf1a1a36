        <h1 id="What-is-the-club’s-full-name"><a href="#What-is-the-club’s-full-name" class="headerlink" title="What is the club’s full name?"></a>What is the club’s full name?</h1><p>The club’s full name is “Juventus Football Club S.p.A.”</p>
<h1 id="What-does-the-club’s-name-mean"><a href="#What-does-the-club’s-name-mean" class="headerlink" title="What does the club’s name mean?"></a>What does the club’s name mean?</h1><p>The club’s name is derived from Iuventus, the Latin name for ETRURIA (the region in Central Italy where Turin is located), and lystä, meaning “to be lustful.” So, the literal translation of Juventus is “the one who is lustful for/of Etruria.” The choice of this name was supposedly made by a group of Torinese students who were looking for a new football club to support in 1897. </p>
<h1 id="How-did-the-club-come-to-be"><a href="#How-did-the-club-come-to-be" class="headerlink" title="How did the club come to be?"></a>How did the club come to be?</h1><p>Juventus was founded on November 1, 1897 by a group of Torinese students who wanted a football club to support. They decided on the name “Juventus” after considering several others, including Audace, Sora, and Pro Vercelli (the latter of which they would eventually join). The first manager was Lasso Arrighi. </p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-important-moments-in-Juventus-history"><a href="#What-are-some-important-moments-in-Juventus-history" class="headerlink" title="What are some important moments in Juventus history?"></a>What are some important moments in Juventus history?</h1><p>Some important moments in Juventus history include: winning their first league title in 1905-06; becoming the first Italian team to win the European Cup (now known as the Champions League) in 1977-78; and controversially being relegated to Serie B (Italy’s second division) due to a match-fixing scandal in 2006.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-their-nickname"><a href="#What-is-their-nickname" class="headerlink" title="What is their nickname?"></a>What is their nickname?</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in Oakland, California. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league’s Western Conference Pacific Division. The Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1962, the franchise relocated to San Francisco, California and changed its name to the San Francisco Warriors. In 1971, the team was renamed the Golden State Warriors after becoming located in Oakland.</p>
<p>The Warriors have won six NBA championships: in 1947, 1956, 1975, 2015, 2017 and 2018. They are one of four NBA teams to have won at least three championships since 2000. As of July 2018, the Warriors had the best record in the NBA season (58–24),winning their third straight championship and fourth in five years.</p>
<p>The Warriors nickname comes from their early association with gold mining.</p>
<h1 id="Which-ground-do-they-play-at"><a href="#Which-ground-do-they-play-at" class="headerlink" title="Which ground do they play at?"></a>Which ground do they play at?</h1><p>Which ground do they play at?<br>For many years the team played at their traditional home of Maine Road, before moving to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003.<br>The City of Manchester Stadium has a capacity of 47,746, making it the largest club ground in England.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-the-current-manager"><a href="#Who-is-the-current-manager" class="headerlink" title="Who is the current manager?"></a>Who is the current manager?</h1><p>The current manager of the club is Arsène Wenger. He was appointed on 1 October 1996 and is the longest-serving Arsenal manager and the second longest-serving manager in Premier League history.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-Bundesliga-titles-have-they-won"><a href="#How-many-Bundesliga-titles-have-they-won" class="headerlink" title="How many Bundesliga titles have they won?"></a>How many Bundesliga titles have they won?</h1><p>Since 1963, Bayern Munich have lifted the Bundesliga title an impressive 26 times. This puts them leagues ahead of any other team in the German top-flight, with nearest rivals Borussia Dortmund way behind on six titles.</p>
<p>Bayern’s dominance of German football can be traced back to their early years. The club was founded in 1900 as Münchner FC but didn’t win their first title until 1932. They then went on to lift the championship four more times in the 1930s.</p>
<p>After World War II, Bayern struggled to reestablish themselves as one of Europe’s top clubs. They did win the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) in 1957 and finished runners-up in the Bundesliga in 1965, but it wasn’t until the 1970s that they really began to assert themselves.</p>
<p>Led by legendary coach Udo Lattek, Bayern won their first Bundesliga title in 1969 and followed that up with successive championships in 1972 and 1973. They also reached the European Cup final for the first time in 1974, losing out to Dutch side Feyenoord Rotterdam.</p>
<p>The club continued to dominate German football throughout the 1970s and 1980s, winning a further eight Bundesliga titles. Legendary players like Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge helped lead Bayern to success during this period.</p>
<p>The 1990s saw a slight decline for Bayern, with two successive third-place finishes in the Bundesliga. They did win the DFB-Pokal twice during this decade, however, and reached the Champions League final in 2000 where they were beaten by Spanish giants Valencia.</p>
<p>The 2000s saw a resurgence for Bayern Munich, culminating in their most successful period ever. The club won six Bundesliga titles between 2001 and 2013 as well as firing home Europe’s biggest prize – the Champions League – on three occasions (2001–02, 2012–13 and 2014–15). Pep Guardiola was arguably the mastermind behind these successes, with his trademark high-intensity possession style suiting Bayern perfectly.</p>

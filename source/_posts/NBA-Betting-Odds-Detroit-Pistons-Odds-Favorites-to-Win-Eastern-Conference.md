#  NBA Betting Odds: Detroit Pistons Odds Favorites to Win Eastern Conference

The Detroit Pistons come into the 2018-2019 NBA season as odds favorites to win the Eastern Conference. This is a big change from a year ago when they were considered borderline playoff contenders. The additions of Blake Griffin and Dwyane Wade have transformed this team into a legitimate championship contender.

Most pundits believe that the Boston Celtics are still the team to beat in the East, but there is increasing chatter that the Philadelphia 76ers could be ready to take over as the top dog. Regardless of who is favored to win the conference, it’s clear that the Pistons are one of the teams to watch this season.

Griffin and Wade bring a wealth of experience and championship pedigree to Detroit, and both players are still in their prime. Griffin averaged 21.6 points per game last season with Los Angeles, while Wade averaged 18.3 points per game in Miami. These two will provide a huge boost to an offense that was ranked just 21st in the league last season.

Andre Drummond is one of the most underrated players in the NBA and he forms a formidable frontcourt tandem with Griffin. Reggie Jackson is back at point guard after an injury-plagued campaign last season, and he should be much better now that he has some continuity with his new teammates.

The Pistons have all of the pieces in place to make a deep run in the playoffs this season. If everything goes according to plan,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) they could very well be hoisting the Eastern Conference trophy in June.

#  NBA Playoffs: Detroit Pistons vs Milwaukee Bucks Preview and Prediction

The Detroit Pistons and Milwaukee Bucks face off in the first round of the NBA playoffs. This series is a rematch of last year’s first round, which the Bucks won 4-1.

The Bucks are the 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, while the Pistons are the 8 seed. The Bucks have the advantage in nearly every category, including scoring (117.5 ppg to 107.3 ppg), rebounds (47.0 rpg to 42.9 rpg), blocks (6.1 bpg to 5.4 bpg), and assists (27.0 apg to 22.3 apg).

The only category that the Pistons have an advantage in is turnovers (13.8 to 14.3). However, this is not enough to make up for all of the other advantages that the Bucks have.

Prediction: Bucks win 4-1

#  NBA Playoffs: Detroit Pistons Take on LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers

In the NBA playoffs, the Detroit Pistons take on LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavs are heavily favored to win, but the Pistons could pull off an upset.

The Cavaliers are led by LeBron James, who is one of the best players in the NBA. He is a four-time MVP and three-time champion. The Cavaliers also have Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, who are two of the best players in the league.

The Pistons are led by Blake Griffin. Griffin is a five-time All-Star and one-time All-NBA player. He is a matchup nightmare for opposing teams because he can score inside and outside. The Pistons also have Andre Drummond, who is one of the best rebounders in the NBA.

If the Pistons can slow down LeBron James, they have a chance to win this series. If Griffin can score at will against Cleveland’s defense, then the Pistons could pull off an upset.

#  NBA Free Agency: Detroit Pistons to Pursue Gordon Hayward

The Detroit Pistons have long been a team with potential but no real championship contender. Stan Van Gundy, head coach and president of basketball operations for the Pistons, is looking to change that this offseason. Hayward will be the focus of their free agency efforts.

Hayward is coming off an excellent season in which he averaged 21.9 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game while shooting 47 percent from the field and 39 percent from three-point range. He would be an excellent fit next to Andre Drummond in Detroit’s frontcourt.

The Pistons also have plenty of cap room to offer Hayward a max contract this summer. They could potentially create even more cap space by trading away Reggie Jackson or Avery Bradley.

There will be plenty of competition for Hayward’s services this summer, but the Pistons are in a good position to land him if they make a strong pitch.

#  Detroit Pistons emerge as contenders in Eastern Conference

The Detroit Pistons have made a number of changes in the offseason and they are looking to improve on their 44-38 record from last season. With the additions of Blake Griffin, Langston Galloway and Avery Bradley, the Pistons are now considered contenders in the Eastern Conference.

Griffin was acquired in a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers and he is expected to provide a major boost to the Pistons' offense. He is a five-time All-Star and he has averaged 21.6 points per game throughout his career. Bradley was also acquired in a trade with the Boston Celtics and he is expected to be a key defensive player for the Pistons.

The Pistons also made some key re-signings, such as keeping Reggie Jackson and Jon Leuer. Jackson is coming off a season in which he averaged 18.8 points and 6.2 assists per game, while Leuer averaged 10.2 points and 6.5 rebounds per game.

With the addition of Griffin and Bradley, as well as the return of Jackson and Leuer, the Pistons should be one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference this season. They will likely be competing with teams such as the Boston Celtics, Cleveland Cavaliers and Philadelphia 76ers for one of the top four spots in the conference.

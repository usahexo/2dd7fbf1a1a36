#  AG Shapiro: $1.7 million in illegal sports bets in PA since January 

Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced Thursday that his office has made more than 1,700 illegal sports bets since the beginning of 2018, with nearly all of those bets placed in Pennsylvania. 

Shapiro said the investigation is ongoing and criminal charges are possible.

“My office is committed to rooting out illegal gambling and bringing those responsible to justice,” Shapiro said. “Illegal gambling is a scourge on our communities, and I urge anyone with information about this activity to contact my office immediately.” 

The attorney general didn't release the names of the casinos or individuals involved in the illegal sports betting. 

Commercial casinos in Pennsylvania are licensed and regulated by the state gaming control board. The board's executive deputy director, Robert Godshall, said any illegal activity would be dealt with swiftly. 

"Illegal gambling will not be tolerated in Pennsylvania," Godshall said. "If we have information that indicates it's happening, we will work with the Attorney General's office to take appropriate enforcement actions." 

Illegal sports betting is a third-degree felony under Pennsylvania law.

#  What Exactly is at Stake with Sports Betting? 

Athletes put their entire careers on the line when they compete. Millions of dollars are on the table, but there is more at stake than just material possessions. The athletes’ mental states can also be severely impacted by sports betting.

International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach addressed the issue of how sports betting can impact athletes in a recent interview. Bach said that athletes need to be protected from the negative aspects of betting and that they are “at risk when it comes to manipulation and cheating”.

Athletes aren’t the only ones who stand to lose when things go wrong with sports betting; fans, too, can be hurt. In fact, in some cases, fans may even be worse off than the athletes themselves. For example, in 2011 a Italian football fan committed suicide after his team lost a major game. This is just one example of how sports betting can cause serious harm to individuals outside of the athlete community.

So what can be done to protect athletes and fans from the dangers of sports betting? One solution is for authorities to crack down on illegal gambling activity. This will help to ensure that all bets placed are fair and above board. Additionally, authorities could work with sporting organizations to create rules and regulations around sports betting. This would help to protect both athletes and fans from any potential negative consequences associated with betting on sporting events.

Ultimately, it is important to remember that sports betting is a serious business. When things go wrong – as they often do – people can get hurt. It is crucial that we take steps to protect those who are most vulnerable, including athletes and fans.

#  Provinces Want Clarity on What exactly is Legal in Regards to Sports Betting 

The provincial governments of Canada are looking for clarification on the legality of sports betting within their respective borders. The newly elected government in Ontario has already pledged to put an end to the illegal sports betting that is currently taking place, but they need to know what is and is not legal before they can take any action.

British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Quebec all held meetings with various federal ministers in order to get some clarity on the issue. Federal officials were reportedly non-committal about the matter, stating that it is up to the provinces to decide if they want to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.

Many people are betting illegally on sports games across Canada, as there is currently no legal way to do so. This creates a large black market for sports betting,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) which the provincial governments would like to see come under their jurisdiction in order to better control and tax it.

It is estimated that Canadians wager billions of dollars on sports each year, most of which is done illegally. If the provinces were able to legalize and regulate sports betting themselves, they would stand to make a lot of money in taxes. It is unclear at this point how much money exactly could be made, but it is certainly a significant sum.

Legalizing and regulating sports betting would also provide jobs for many people in the gaming industry. There are currently many illegal bookmakers operating in Canada, and if sports betting was legalized they would have to become legitimate businesses in order to stay afloat. This would create jobs for people in customer service, marketing, accounting, and many other areas.

The provincial governments seem keen on legalizing and regulating sports betting within their borders, but they first need some clarity from the federal government about what is and is not allowed. It will be interesting to see what happens over the next few months as this issue continues to be debated.

#  The State of Nevada has Revealed what exactly is in Sports Bets

The state of Nevada has released the regulations for sports betting that will be going into effect in the state on October 1. These regulations have clarified which bets will be legal and which ones won’t be. In total, there are 37 different types of bets that will be allowed.

The list of legal bets includes things like point spread, money line, totals, parlays, teasers, If Bets, and reverse wagers. There are also a number of prop bets that will be allowed, including things like who will win the first game of the World Series and what the over/under is on Lebron James’ points scored in his first game with the Lakers.

One interesting thing to note is that the state has ruled that in-game betting will not be legal. This means that you won’t be able to place a bet on whether or not a goal is going to be scored in soccer or whether a runner is going to get a hit in baseball once the game has started.

There are a few types of bets that won’t be legal in Nevada. These include things like futures (such as betting on who will win the Super Bowl), betting against teams (known as “side betting”), and parlay cards.

Nevada is one of only a few states where sports betting will be legal after the Supreme Court struck down the federal ban on it in May. Other states that have announced plans to allow sports betting include Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

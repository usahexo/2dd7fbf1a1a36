#  Colorado Rockies rake in dough from Sin City gambling

The Colorado Rockies baseball team is cashing in on its strong performance this season — thanks in part to money flowing in from Las Vegas gambling.

A recent report by The Associated Press found the team earned more than $19 million in revenue last year from gaming interests, including casinos and sports books. That’s up from about $10 million in 2017.

 Rockies President and CEO Dick Monfort told the AP that the increase is due largely to the team’s success on the field, which has led to more betting on its games.

The Rockies, who are currently in first place in their division, have been a popular pick for gamblers in Las Vegas for much of the season. According to ESPN, the team has attracted nearly twice as much money in bets as any other National League squad.

That’s good news for the team, but it could also lead to some conflict of interest issues down the road. Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred recently said he’s concerned about teams earning significant revenue from gambling interests, and he may look into implementing new rules to address the issue.

“The real challenge for us is making sure that we don’t have situations where teams are either directly or indirectly competing with us for legalized betting dollars,” Manfred said recently, according to The New York Times.

For now, however, the Rockies appear content to rake in the cash while they can. And with a strong chance of reaching the playoffs again this year, their revenues are likely only going to increase.

#  Colorado Rockies lead MLB in money earned from Sin City gambling 

The Colorado Rockies have had a great season on the baseball diamond and it’s now time to cash in on their success. According to a report from VSiN, the Rockies lead all of baseball in money earned from gambling in Las Vegas during the 2018 season.

Colorado took in over $1 million from sports books in Sin City, more than any other team in MLB. The next closest team was the Detroit Tigers, who earned just over $600,000.

While a lot of this gambling action is likely due to recreational bettors simply taking advantage of the high odds on Colorado to win games, it’s still an impressive accomplishment for a team that’s generally not one of the favorites to make it to the World Series.

This news comes as no surprise to those who have been closely following the Rockies this year. The team is currently 84-68 and sits in first place in the NL West division. They are also 7-3 in their last 10 games and have been one of the most consistent teams in MLB this season.

Fans of the Rockies should enjoy this gambling success while they can, as it’s likely that their odds will start to increase as they move closer to clinching a playoff berth.

#  Colorado Rockies raking in millions from Sin City gambling industry 

The Colorado Rockies raked in millions of dollars from the Sin City gambling industry in 2017. According to a recent report by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the Rockies earned $6.7 million from gambling activities at their stadium last year.

This money comes from the bets that are placed on the games at the Coors Field stadium sportsbook. The Rockies were one of only three MLB teams to earn more than $5 million from gambling in 2017. The others were the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox.

The Yankees earned $8.1 million, while the Red Sox pulled in $6.9 million. This is likely due to the fact that both of those teams have large fanbases in states where gambling is legal. The Yankees play their home games in New York City, which has numerous casinos, and the Red Sox play their home games in Boston, which also has a number of casinos.

The Rockies are not as popular as those two teams, but they do have a strong following in Colorado, which is one of the states where gambling is legal. This is likely why they were able to generate so much money from gambling last year.

It will be interesting to see if this trend continues in 2018. The Yankees and Red Sox are once again among the top earners from gambling, while the Rockies have fallen down to fifth place. It’s possible that this is just a fluke and that the Rockies will again be among the top earners from gambling this year, but it’s also possible that they have started to lose some of their appeal to gamblers.

Only time will tell who ends up winning this battle for betting dollars. In any case, it’s clear that Major League Baseball teams are continuing to make a lot of money from legalized gambling across the country.

#  Arizona Diamondbacks second to Colorado Rockies in earnings from Sin City gambling 

The Arizona Diamondbacks have brought in just over $1.5 million from gambling this season, while their divisional rivals, the Colorado Rockies, have raked in over $2.7 million. This disparity is largely due to the Rockies' centralized location in the gambling capital of the world, Las Vegas.

The Diamondbacks are one of two National League West teams that do not call Las Vegas home; instead, they play in Phoenix, a relatively small market when compared to Denver. The Cardinals are the other team in the division that does not play in Sin City; however, they only rank 12th out of all 30 teams in terms of earnings from gambling.

As it turns out, Arizona's hitters may want to thank their pitchers for keeping them out of last place; if the D-Backs placed dead last in this category, their players would have only earned about $830,000 from gambling this season.

#  James Bond Suffers From a Rare Disease in Casino Royale

In the 2006 James Bond movie Casino Royale, Daniel Craig’s Bond character suffers from a rare disease. The filmmakers were secretive about what the disease was and only revealed that it was something “not seen very often.”

Now, ten years later, it has been confirmed that Bond suffers from Myasthenia Gravis (MG), a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder.

MG is characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. It can affect any muscle in the body, including the heart and lungs. In severe cases, MG can lead to paralysis.

There is no cure for MG, but there are treatments available that can help control the symptoms. The goal of treatment is to keep the patient as active and independent as possible.

James Bond’s struggle with MG is a reminder that this is a serious disease that can affect anyone, even someone who seems as fit and healthy as 007.

# 2. James Bond's Illness Was a Secret Until Now

It was recently revealed that for a significant portion of his life, James Bond was battling a serious illness. The secret was kept from the general public until now due to fears that it would hurt the character's image. However, with the release of his latest movie, it is being revealed that he has been suffering from bipolar disorder.

This mental illness causes extreme changes in mood, and for Bond it manifested in wild mood swings and reckless behavior. He would often go on drinking binges or engage in other dangerous activities. In fact, at one point he even considered suicide as an option.

Despite this, Bond continued to work as an agent and even became more successful over time. It is only recently that he has started to openly talk about his illness and seek treatment. This has allowed him to take control of his life and live more peacefully.

The revelation of Bond's illness has generated a lot of discussion online, with many people offering their opinions on the matter. Some feel that it makes him seem more human and relatable while others believe that it ruins his image. What do you think?

# 3. Casino Royale: How Bond Got His Illness

The first time that Ian Fleming's Casino Royale depicted Bond getting sick was in the 1967 edition. The scene played out with Bond hallucinating during a torture session as Le Chiffre questioned him about the location of the secret British base.

Bond began to see green spiders crawling all over his body and face. Then, he started to experience excruciating pain in his stomach and chest. The hallucinations became so unbearable that Bond eventually passed out from the stress.

This scene marked a significant deviation from Fleming's original novel, which did not include any reference to Bond being ill. In fact, Fleming actually wrote in an earlier draft of the novel that Bond was "as fit as a fiddle."

So why did the filmmakers decide to add this new element to Bond's story? There are a few possible explanations.

First, it could be interpreted as an attempt to further humanize Bond and make him more relatable to audiences. By showing that he is vulnerable to physical and psychological stress, it makes him seem more like an ordinary person rather than a superhuman action hero.

Second, it could be seen as an indication of the toll that the job is taking on him. We see throughout the series that 007 often risks his life and endures a lot of pain and suffering, both physically and emotionally. This scene suggests that all of this has begun to take its toll, and that 007 is starting to crack under the pressure.

Finally, it could be seen as an early warning sign of the health problems that Bond will eventually suffer from later in life. It's been well-documented that James Bond has a number of dangerous vices – smoking, drinking, etc. – which can take a toll on his health. Scenes like this one suggest that these habits may eventually catch up with him, causing long-term damage to his body.

# 4. The Real Reason Why James Bond Got Sick in Casino Royale

The popular consensus is that Daniel Craig’s James Bond became sick from ingesting dangerous levels of adrenaline during a high-stakes poker game at the beginning of Casino Royale. However, if you look closely at the scene, you can see that Bond doesn’t actually vomit until after he has been poisoned with knockout gas by Le Chiffre.

In fact, the true reason why Bond gets sick in Casino Royale is because he has been infected with Ebola virus. The filmmakers cleverly disguised the virus by altering the appearance of the vomit to make it look like adrenaline. This was done to avoid alarming movie-goers and to keep the focus on the story rather than on a possible health scare.

Why did the filmmakers choose to include Ebola in Casino Royale? There could be any number of reasons, but one possibility is that they were trying to call attention to the global epidemic of the disease. In 2005, when Casino Royale was released, there had been several outbreaks of Ebola virus infection in Africa, which had captured the world’s attention.

Whatever the filmmakers’ motivations may have been, Ebola makes for an interesting and suspenseful addition to the plot of Casino Royale. It helps to explain Bond’s sudden illness and leads to some dramatic scenes as Bond races against time to find a cure.

# 5. Was Casino Royale Based on a True Story? Find Out Who Had the Real-Life James Bond Disease

Casino Royale was not based on a true story, but it did incorporate elements from the life of author Ian Fleming. Fleming was a British intelligence officer during World War II, and many of his experiences formed the basis for the James Bond character.

Fleming was diagnosed with poliomyelitis in 1944, which limited his mobility and forced him to retire from the military in 1945. He turned to writing as a way to make a living, and his first novel was Casino Royale, which was published in 1953. The book is credited with starting the James Bond franchise.

While Casino Royale is not based on a true story, some of the plot points are inspired by Fleming's own life. For example, James Bond is diagnosed with polio in the book, just as Fleming was. And like Bond, Fleming was an expert at poker.
